# Forecasting cash withdrawals at ATMs and optimizing cash management
  The essence of the project is that a system is being developed that consists of two parts.
  First, it predicts cash withdrawals at ATMs using three methods of triple exponential smoothing (Holt-Winters), recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (RNN LSTM), and singular spectral analysis (SSA).


and optimizing loading cash into ATMs.
